## Songtexten

### Songbird - Fleetwood Mac

For you, there'll be no more crying  
For you, the sun will be shining  
And I feel that when I'm with you  
It's alright, I know it's right  

To you, I would give the world  
To you, I'll never be cold  
'Cause I feel that when I'm with you  
It's alright, I know it's right  

And the songbirds are singing,  
Like they know the score  
And I love you, I love you, I love you  
Like never before  

And I wish you all the love in the world  
But most of all, I wish it from myself  

And the songbirds keep singing  
Like they know the score  
And I love you, I love you, I love you  
Like never before  


### Water Is Wide - Rory Block

The water is wide, I can't cross over  
And neither I have wings to fly  
Give me a boat carry two  
And both shall row, my love and I  

Love is gentle, love is kind  
The sweetest flower when first it blooms  
But love grows old and waxes cold  
And fades away like morning dew  

There is a ship that sails the sea  
She's loaded deep as deep can be  
But not as deep as the love I made  
I know not how I'll sink or swim  

The water is wide, I can't cross over  
And neither I have wings to fly  
Give me a boat that can carry two  
And both shall row, my love and I  

And both shall row, my love and I  

### Baker Street - Gerry Rafferty

Winding your way down on Baker Street  
Light in your head and dead on your feet  
Well, another crazy day  
You'll drink the night away  
And forget about everything  

This city desert makes you feel so cold  
It's got so many people, but it's got no soul  
And it's taken you so long  
To find out you were wrong  
When you thought it held everything  

You used to think that it was so easy  
You used to say that it was so easy  
But you're trying, you're trying now  

Another year and then you'd be happy  
Just one more year and then you'd be happy  
But you're crying, you're crying now  

*(Saxofoon solo)*  

Way down the street there's a light in his place  
He opens the door, he's got that look on his face  
And he asks you where you've been  
You tell him who you've seen  
And you talk about anything  

He's got this dream about buying some land  
He's gonna give up the booze and the one-night stands  
And then he'll settle down  
In some quiet little town  
And forget about everything  

But you know he'll always keep moving  
You know he's never gonna stop moving  
'Cause he's rolling, he's the rolling stone  
When you wake up, it's a new morning  
The sun is shining, it's a new morning  
You're going, you're going home  

### Natalie Merchant - Motherland  

Where in the hell can you go  
Far from the things that you know  
Far from the sprawl of concrete that keeps Crawling its way  
about 1,000 miles a day  

Take one last look behind,  
Commit this to memory and mind.  
Don't miss this wasteland, this terrible place  
When you leave, keep your heart off your sleeve  

Motherland cradle me,  
Close my eyes, lullaby me to sleep.  
Keep me safe, lie with me, stay beside me don't go  

Oh, my five and dime queen  
Tell me what have you seen?  
The lust and the avarice,  
The bottomless, Cavernous greed,  
Is that what you see?  

Motherland cradle me,  
Close my eyes, lullaby me to sleep.  
Keep me safe, lie with me, stay beside me don't go  

It's your happiness I want most of all  
And for that I'd do anything at all (oh mercy me)  

If you want the best of me, or the most of Love  
If there's anything I can do at all ?  

Now come on shot gun bride  
What makes me envy your might?  
Faceless, nameless, innocent, blameless and free,  
What's that like to be?
